NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice - Send IRC notices from your dancer app

SYNOPSIS
      use Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice;

      notify('This is a notification');

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice provides a quick and dirty way to send IRC
    NOTICEs to a specific channel.

    This is very alpha software right now. No error checking is done.

CONFIGURATION
      plugins:
        IRCNotice:
          host: 'chat.freenode.net'
          nick: 'testnick12345'
          name: 'Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotify'
          channel: '#dpintest'
          type: 'notice'

    The host, nick, name, and channel should be pretty obvious.

    The type parameter lets you pick the type of message to send. The
    default is "notice" which sends a notice to the channel. You can also
    choose "message" which well send a normal message to the channel.

TODO
    This is so bootleg, it really needs to be cleaned up to handle IRC
    correctly. Unfortunately, all of the IRC modules I saw on cpan are event
    based monstrosities so this just uses IO::Socket::IP to connect.

    The notify routine should probably let you override the settings or
    maybe I should use something like Dancer::Plugin::DBIC to define
    multiple notifiers that can then be used.

    A connection to IRC must be made for each notification presently.
    Instead, it should try to keep a connection open and reuse it or
    something.
