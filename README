NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice - Send IRC notices from your dancer app

SYNOPSIS
      use Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice;

      notify('This is a notification');

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotice provides a quick and dirty way to send IRC
    NOTICEs to a specific channel.

    This is very alpha software right now. No error checking is done and it
    uses a fork to (optionally) background the process of sending the
    notice.

CONFIGURATION
      plugins:
        IRCNotice:
          host: 'chat.freenode.net'
          nick: 'testnick12345'
          name: 'Dancer::Plugin::IRCNotify'
          channel: '#dpintest'
          fork: 1

    The host, nick, name, and channel should be pretty obvious. If fork is
    set to a true value, the plugin will fork and background the sending of
    the notice.

TODO
    This is so bootleg, it really needs to be cleaned up to handle IRC
    correctly. Unfortunately, all of the IRC modules I saw on cpan are event
    based monstrosities so this just uses IO::Socket::IP to connect.

    The notify routine should probably let you override the settings or
    maybe I should use something like Dancer::Plugin::DBIC to define
    multiple notifiers that can then be used.

    A connection to IRC must be made for each notification presently.
    Instead, it should try to keep a connection open and reuse it or
    something. However, that would require threads instead of simple
    forking, and I'm not sure how that will play with whatever plack
    frontend people are using.
